## Adding docs to your project

If you already have an existing build process, please check the migration guide. If not, then you can add an (empty) documentation by the following steps:

1.  Create new site. From the project repository root:

    -   `hugo new site docs`
    -   `cd docs`
    -   `hugo mod init pages.oxnet/{GROUP}/{PROJECT_PATH}` <-- replace with local repo group and name
        -   e.g. `hugo mod init pages.oxnet/ig/ndo-app`
    -   `hugo mod get github.com/ouhft/docsy@45c4a583f9604d20b96917d280f39537bae31084`
        -   This is a known good commit/release to use, and will be updated over time as required[^tag].
    -   `mkdir -p content/en`

2.  Copy example [hugo.yaml](#) and modify to suit your needs (see Current Configuration below)

3.  Update .gitlab-ci.yml to include v3.0.x pages template

    ```yml
    include:
      - remote: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ouhft/docsy/ouhft/.gitlab-ci-templates/pages-3-0-0.yml
    ```

4.  Now you can go create content following the rest of this guide, starting with `/docs/content/en/_index.md` as your homepage.

### What's the minimum needed?

In the 3.x setup, the minimum file structure for automated documentation building looks like:

-   `docs/`  <-- convention based folder name, used for consistency across projects
    -   `content/`  <-- hugo expects to find user generated content in here
        -   `en/`  <-- hugo is multi-lingual, and to ensure future compatibility we use the "en" folder for English content
            -   `_index.md`  <-- The first page that will be rendered
    -   `go.mod`  <-- hugo/go module file, autogenerated
    -   `go.sum`  <-- hugo/go module file, autogenerated
    -   `hugo.yaml`  <-- hugo site configuration file
-   `.gitlab-ci.yml`  <-- gitlab CI configuration file

### Current Configuration

{{% readfile file="/hugo.yaml" code="true" lang="yaml" %}}

<!-- Footnotes -->
[^tag]: Ideally we'll get to the point where we can tag specific releases, though as this is being initially written whilst the 3.x branch is being created, we are using specific commits to keep up with changes.
